    <h5>About</h5>
    <p>
      This is a playground for experimenting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conways
      Game of Life</a>.

      There are certain rules by which a cell in each frame either dies or is reincarnated:
    <ol>
      <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.</li>
      <li>Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.</li>
      <li>All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h5>Configure the board</h5>
    <p>
      Click (or draw/drag) on the grid below to toggle cells on or off (the draw behaviour can be changed -- see 'Mouse
      Click/Drag Behaviour' below).
    </p>
    <h5>Playing the game</h5>
    <p>
      Use the "Play" button below to start/stop the animation, or the "Advance Once" button to advance a single frame.
    </p>
    <h5>Loading different models</h5>
    <p>
      The text area below the grid shows a textual representation of the board. You can manually edit that text, then use the "Load board from ascii" button to reset the board.
    </p>
    <p>
      A small sample of existing models are also available from the "Use Model" drop-down, which were taken from <a href="https://conwaylife.com/patterns">conwaylife.com/patterns</a>.
